#summary A detailed overview of the js.stats API

= Introduction =
The function _stats()_ acts as a clearing house for all other functions in the library. It handles data scrubing, handles errors, and uses a simple _switch_ statement to determine which request to use.


= Parameters =
_stats()_ accepts three parameters: `request`, `data`, and `decimal_place`.


= Error handling =
When the wrong data is passed to _stats()_ the function will return "ERROR: " followed by a plain English error message. For example, if a user tries to pass the array ["apple", "banana", "orange"] they would get the following response:
{{{
return "ERROR: apple is not a number";
}}}
